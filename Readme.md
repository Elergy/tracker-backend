An API for the 'Making Single Page Applications with Javascript' course.

In this course, students will create a sample application for tracking time for their tasks.
Tasks can be grouped into projects and can have multiple tags.

In this application users should be able to do:  
  1. Create an account and log into the system 
  2. Start and stop tracking an activity 
  3. Create projects to group tasks into them 
  4. Edit some information about tasks and projects: change title, change color, remove some items 
  5. Get reports about their activity: 
    1. All tracked tasks sorted by start time
    2. All tracked tasks by some filters (with particular projects or tags)
    3. Aggregated information about amount of time they spent on some activities, grouped by project or tag
